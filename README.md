# Interview Task README

## Overview
This repository contains an interview task that focuses on building a single-page widget 

## Task Details
The task involves creating a single widget page without using any specific formatting libraries for dates, date pickers, or form management. The purpose is to assess the candidate's ability to implement basic functionality without relying on pre-built solutions.

### Approach
- **Date Formatting**: Instead of using a formatting library, raw JavaScript date methods were utilized for date formatting.
- **Date Picker**: No date picker package was employed. The date input was handled using native HTML `<input type="date">` element.
- **Form Management**: Since it's a single-page widget without complex form management requirements, no form management package like Formik was used.

### Additional Considerations
- **Full Project Development**: For a full project, caching libraries like React Query or SWR could be employed for data management.
- **Theming**: Utilization of Tailwind CSS for theming could enhance the design and styling aspect.
- **Multilingual Support**: Implementation of multilingual support could be integrated if required.
- **Further Requirements**: If additional functionalities or proofs of expertise are necessary, please specify.
